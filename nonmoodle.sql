','3',3,5,4,4,5,'Discussion. ','More in depth look at learning gaps. What\'s the purpose of closing all these learnings gaps -  as it relates to different mathematical concepts. Like why are all these different concepts and procedural so needed to be grasped? There have been learning gaps since the dawn of mandatory schooling and none of the money/resources we\'ve thrown at this issue has helped much -  so how can we truly make a difference from a systems perspective? What about the system is flawed or outdated? What about the system is skewed toward whites? Why are black and brown students on a whole scoring lower on national assessments? How do we change that from a national and district level? What districts or states are having tremendous success is closing gaps and why are they successful? \n\nThere are a lot of why questions I have and answering the why questions helps me feel motivated to answer the how questions. I think some of the how questions were answered for me but not many why questions. In a sense -  I feel  this was another superficial course on how to close learning gaps among students but will not actually produce any results because the system at large is flawed at so many levels. Yes -  teachers can make a difference in the learning gaps but nationally we need to do some real evaluation and change.\n\nI feel like this whole training could have been summed up with one sentence: \"Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps.\" And then maybe giving a list of what just-in-time support looks like. \n ',3,'Because they \"course\" could have been summed up with an hour or less of information. \"Teach your grade level content while creating space/time for just-in-time support for scholars who have learning gaps.\" And then maybe giving a list of what just-in-time support looks like. Yes, implementing these practices will help close some learning gaps. But there are so many more important topics to be discussing when it comes to learning and learning gaps. Once again many of the why questions connected to learning gaps are not brought up or discussed. It\'s like when Nixon was president he declared a \"war\" on cancer and threw all this money into research efforts to reduce cancer in America but nothing positive came about from his \"war on cancer\". Cancer only got worse and worse in America! Concerning Education, we are having all this discussion on learning gaps and what not but never seeking to understand the root of our issues in education across America. The education tree in America is dead or at best dying and we keep expecting to receive healthy fruit. Cut down the tree and plant a new one! Learn from nations or people groups who are getting great education results. \n\nWe have been talking about learning gaps for decades and nothing has changed! Why? There is something bigger going on behind the scenes that needs to be addressed and changed. ','Go into the history of these learning gaps. How did they come about? Has there been success in closing these gaps every? If so where and how? Why are we so concerned about closing the gaps? Why is knowing all these obligatory math standards so important? Students seem to not care about all the unrelated, unconnected, un-useful math standards, why should I be making sure there aren\'t gaps in their learning?',20,22,25,16,NULL,'The discussions'),(15299,1601006400,'Legacy Early College, SC','Teacher or specialist',5,5,5,5,5,5,'I was able to adjust my curriculum map to accelerate the learning of my students.
